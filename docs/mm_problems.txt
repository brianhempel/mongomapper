@one@ doesn't unset associations properly by default
one's mass assignment doesn't call accessors after 1 level
@saving@ associations is horridly inconsistent ... at one point we tried to set an association in a before_save callback and got an infinite loop
@caching@ gotchas happen all the time -- integrate with IdentityMap to make it just work?  MongoMappers underlying association principles are *not simple enough* to expect users to handle edge cases without lots of pain and trial and error.
@two-way many-to-many@ polymorphism is unsupported without SCI
@SCI + many@ should be able to work without declaring the association polymorphic
